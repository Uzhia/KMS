Hat. This a handwoven pulou. The brim of this pulou is made of a thin piece of wood that has been curved to form a large circle. On the inside of the brim is a series of three circles made of ofe (bamboo), each decreasing in size the closer they are to the crown. The four circular pieces that make up the brim are connected by four strips of ofe that connect at the tip of the crown. This frame forms a conical shape reminiscent of Chinese origin. The frame is then covered with strips of ofe that have been woven using a cross-hatching technique. The frame is also covered roughly by strips of pandanus to cover the small holes between the woven ofe. The outer surface of the pulou has been stained a dark brown, nearly black, colour. The underside of the pulou reveals the true brown colour of the materials used as well as the weaving techniques used to create it. Where the crown meets the brim is yet another circle of woven bamboo that is attached perpendicular to the pulou. This circle acts as a headband that allows the conical pulou to sit comfortably on the wearers head. Attached also to the underside of the pulou are two chinstraps. The smaller of the two straps is made of a black elastic string. While the larger of the two straps is made of wool that has been fili (braided) using a fili lua (two ply braid) technique. This pulou is indicative of the migration of Chinese to Samoa in the late 1800's. A pulou such as this would have been worn as protection from both the sun and rain.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/507825?k=chinese,https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357493/7debad0661f80dce9d4f09834bbb552e89ca632d.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357494/f24a60ae69dcd3016910797288646a2b14a874ba.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357495/af0759cbe53f75aa9e392611ac4b6dde8d62dfbb.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357496/a11836076d26834081668bfd7806f0886f70e905.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357497/608f23d31ab9653fac09f88e5798c3d3b6c1f875.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357498/de5c2ec93ccdd2c12c130ba90fbf20e1bc9b56fe.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357499/ae7c29e07cf2e3cbb642a382bc0e524dcf61c9c3.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357500/21a4c63745f60aa7772a0c52e5e03ae78cfd382c.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357501/d6ca91f5db5580251f595c1c919c2b441d4daaba.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357502/6df8cb309419ede3f17cc19a88bcf41e5d4a840f.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357503/211db01fc7b38848a558e5bd8d6f70fdb271ee3f.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357504/b4b4149cc8fecf9382d3ff9b8f82ff5bc6710bcc.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357505/92a395b77893b02b29904e6617affa15f5de8e5d.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357506/d3b8cbd54f6e4352258742c5e763705a6c6358f8.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357507/cfd8abf7c13e251f603a5903390cc65138444363.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357508/0f24011b6579955a002a488c7ac74325abe179d0.jpg; https://collection-api.aucklandmuseum.com/records/images/medium/357509/ab57910465e51424778fc1bdc7d3e9cc2bf57cba.jpg

There is evidence that this design may have been much bigger at one stage, with the right hand side (LP) border swallowing some of the design where the panels meet.; There is more evidence throughout where elements are remade and old designs covered. The most obvious of these are the pine(?) flower embroidery at the top is strategically covering large gold Chinese characters.; ; The back is lined with a red fabric. In the central embroidered panel is a figure of a woman with a smaller child to her right. On either side of this are a tiger in a falling position with a man on the outside wrestling another tiger. Above and below this are sets of skinny elephants, two pairs above and one set below. Along the top is two dragons and at the bottom is two animals fighting? With a bird(pheasant?) at the shoulder of the left figure. The background is embroidered all over with bats, clouds and Taoist emblems, nature scenes and at the bottom houses and land.; ; Surrounding this is a border of large Chinese symbols/characters in couched gold thread. Then a border of repeating clouds and suns then a slightly larger border of figures doing things in couched gold thread and silk floss embroidery. There is then another skinny border of a meander pattern. The outside edge is a larger border again, this time of floral designs and scrolls with Chinese text inside.

It is based quite closely on a subject first used in Palissy ware by Bernard Palissy (flourished 1542-62) in France.; ; The central image depicts a reclining woman with five children playing in front of a draped curtain. The high relief is elaborately highlighted in blue, ochre, yellow and green. The recesses around the rim also have individual scenes. In the top center rondel can be seen the alms of the Guild of Cutlers.; ; From the 14th century large qualities of Chinese blue and white porcelain had been sold in Europe. The European potters had been unable to produce the white body necessary for porcelain, and during the 16th century the discovery was made that tin oxide mixed with clear lead glaze produced and opaque white glaze covering the natural brown clays.

With celadon production at its peak, Korean pottered developed a type of ceramics adorned with a peony design, somewhat like the style and technique used in Chinese Cizhou ware. This wine pot is a superb example of brushed peony (possibly posanghwa) flowers and leaf decoration . The design was painted in iron oxide under the celadon glaze, showing that the Korean potter sometimes adapted Chinese motifs without regard for decorative technique. Designs became bigger and bolder, more spontaneous and more energetic. This allowed the potter to paint the surface freely and directly and was similar in style to Korean mural paintings and gave the pieces a softer edge.

This included the willow, chrysanthemum, crane and bamboo. The most representative of these is the waterfowl among reed and cranes and clouds as seen in this maebyŏng. Cranes and clouds probably derived from Chinese Yue ware. The depiction of such imaginary, fantastic scenes must have appealed to the Goryeo court and aristocracy for whom these ceramics were produced. Korean potters embraced these Chinese designs. The maebyŏng, meaning prunus vase, would have been used as a jug or a wine pot, rather that a vase. Some versions have been found with a small bell shaped lid that indicate they were jars.

1762,plate,Post 1820,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Unknown,195mm; ,ceramic/inorganic material/AAT Materials,"plate, 'tumbledown dick'. ""Plate, part of a service. Tumbledown dick"" pattern, olive green.""; Tumbledown Dick was first recorded in about 1820 with pattern number 2987. The pattern is a copy, or close representation, of a Chinese design of the Yung Cheng period (1723 - 1735).; ; The pattern was produced at Spode in many versions. It was often printed and then coloured. It was also printed and then painted with 'ackey' (a water soluble resist) which allowed the pattern to remain unaffected when a subsequent transfer print of a 'sheet pattern' was applied over the whole surface. At the 'washing-off' stage (when the transfer paper is removed) the areas of the transferred sheet pattern which were over the 'ackey' were washed away leaving the outline of the first pattern. This could then be hand coloured after the gloss firing.; ; This technique was used for a number of patterns when a combination of prints was used. Tumbledown Dick was often used with Marble Sheet as in pattern 3716 of 1823.; ; The name Tumbledown Dick was probably a factory or a collectors' name rather than one chosen for marketing purposes.

Tumbledown dick"" pattern, olive green.""; Tumbledown Dick was first recorded in about 1820 with pattern number 2987. The pattern is a copy, or close representation, of a Chinese design of the Yung Cheng period (1723 - 1735).; ; The pattern was produced at Spode in many versions. It was often printed and then coloured. It was also printed and then painted with 'ackey' (a water soluble resist) which allowed the pattern to remain unaffected when a subsequent transfer print of a 'sheet pattern' was applied over the whole surface. At the 'washing-off' stage (when the transfer paper is removed) the areas of the transferred sheet pattern which were over the 'ackey' were washed away leaving the outline of the first pattern. This could then be hand coloured after the gloss firing.; ; This technique was used for a number of patterns when a combination of prints was used. Tumbledown Dick was often used with Marble Sheet as in pattern 3716 of 1823.; ; The name Tumbledown Dick was probably a factory or a collectors' name rather than one chosen for marketing purposes. One theory is that the name derives from an upside-down dickie bird!; ; In 1980 Tumbledown Dick was produced as dinnerware on fine stone body and named Prince Regent. It had pattern number W160.

In its early incarnations, the association offered kinship and a united voice for an often marginalised and fragile minority. This history recounts the evolution of the Chinese into a community with a sense of place in the diverse population of present-day New Zealand. It tells how a community founded by sojourners and migrants, adapts to a new and sometimes hostile homeland, far from the place of their ancestors' birth. The book is structured into three main sections: The historical narrative about the association -- the work it has performed and its own struggles to maintain a relevant identity as political change ebbed and flowed in both Asia and New Zealand - The events and community involvement of the association, whether as an initiator or as a contributor, including coverage of the branches around the country that form the membership of the NZCA - The names of people involved in the association, from the official records, including the executive officers, conference delegates, organisers of the annual sports tournaments and the recipients of honorary awards.""--Wheeler's website.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1140092?k=chinese,Unknown

52,Challenges in cross-cultural tourism : New Zealand museums and Chinese visitor experience,2018,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reserve Collection,Unknown,Unknown,"This thesis explores Chinese museum visitorship in New Zealand. Recognising the importance of visitor studies in general and the challenges of cosmopolitan audiences in museums, the goal of this thesis is to understand why, when Chinese people have a passion for visiting museums and are keen to come to New Zealand, they are not visiting New Zealand museums in significant numbers, even though Chinese now constitute the second highest number of international tourists for New Zealand, outstripped only by Australia. In order to investigate Chinese museum visitors' experiences, case studies of four representative museums in New Zealand and China were undertaken: the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington, the Auckland War Memorial Museum Tamaki Paenga Hira, the National Museum of China and the Palace Museum in Beijing. Questionnaire surveys and museum employee interviews, together with my own observations, provided data for comparative analysis. By comparing data from these museums, the aim was to discover Chinese preferences and understand their attitudes towards cultural curatorship, museum technology, language assistance, marketing strategies, and commercial services, which has not previously been undertaken. Analysis revealed that Chinese visitors have a strong feeling that New Zealand museums do not make enough special provisions for them. This related particularly to problems of communication because New Zealand museum displays depend heavily on English (and occasionally Maori) texts. While Chinese people considered the Maori content potentially very interesting, and wanted to know about Pakeha-Maori historical relations, most had no effective way of understanding the information provided. They were also interested to see how Chinese people live New Zealand, particularly early settlers, but found little on this. Chinese visitors enjoyed the uncrowded environment and commercial facilities in New Zealand museums compared to those of China, and multimedia forms of exhibition which were easiest for them to understand. But, while they appreciated the use of innovative technology which gave them new learning experiences, they found it disappointing that it was not always accessible to people who could not easily understand English. Chinese museum visitors' foremost concern was Chinese language assistance. Apart from the provision of Mandarin-speaking guides, the most effective language assistance was identified as multi-language audio guides like the Palace Museum 'Explorer' with automatically guided functions. The surveys also identified many smaller issues, such as food preferences, and clarified that the use of social media and the adaptation of technology would make New Zealand museums more accessible to Chinese",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1135396?k=chinese,Unknown

75,Being Chinese : a New Zealander's story,2016,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reading Room; General Collection,Unknown,Unknown,"""This is the story of a quest I began three decades ago - the search for my Chinese identity. The path I travelled was not linear, and the years brought pain as well as joy. But, while this is a narrative about being Chinese and also a New Zealander, I know that the search for purpose and meaning in life is universal. I hope that others in our culturally diverse society will find their own ways to embark on that same journey.; Helene Wong was born in New Zealand in 1949, to parents whose families had emigrated from China one or two generations earlier. Preferring invisibility, she grew up resisting her Chinese identity. But in 1980 she travelled to her father's home village in southern China and came face to face with her ancestral past. What followed was a journey to come to terms with 'being Chinese'. Helene Wong writes eloquently about her New Zealand childhood, about student life in the 1960s, and coming of age in Muldoon's New Zealand. What her Chinese ancestry means to her gradually illuminates the book as it sheds new light on her own life. Drawing on her experience of writing for New Zealand films, she takes the narrative forward through the places of her family's history - the ancestral village of Sha Tou in Zengcheng county, the rural town of Utiku where the Wongs ran a thriving business, the Lower Hutt suburbs of her childhood, and Avalon and Naenae.""--Publisher's information.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1139113?k=chinese,Unknown

Consisting of a technically adroit, full-length DVD documentary film and substantial contextual essay. Serving as historical markers further contributing to the cultural discourse of the Chinese in New Zealand.; Alienated from his Chinese immigrant parents by the circumstance of his mother defying parental expectation in marrying a Pakeha New Zealander and being shunned, Wayne set out to reclaim something of his Chinese identity and heritage by painstakingly reconstructing his Chinese whakapapa and sourcing and interpreting family photographs and home movies across the different generations. Also mediating on his father's absence and life decisions from a subtle subversive yellow (cowardice) viewpoint. The film documents the process with a series of remarkable interviews with his aunts, uncles and parents, and New Zealand Chinese Historian, Dr James Ng.""--back cover.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1135093?k=chinese,Unknown

Standing on a cultural divide they are not accepted by either and each struggles to forge his destiny in the turbulent times. Meanwhile the abandoned Chinese son takes his revenge by qualifying as a doctor in America to live the American dream. Two sons of foreign missionaries must question their loyalties when confronted by these Chinese. Destinies Divided: A World War 1 Romance of the Chinese Diaspora takes them through a journey of over ten thousand miles and pitches them all together in Flanders where each must create his own reality as he watches the destruction of his fellow men in the cruellest war in modern history. A war in which nearly 200,000 Chinese coolies, unsung and forgotten, struggle and die in an attempt to regain China's self-respect as a sovereign nation.

Growing up in Italy, she lived through the rise of Fascism and the Second World War. Next she went to China and found herself in the midst of the Chinese Revolution. Then she travelled to the other side of the world at the invitation of a New Zealand soldier whom she had met at the end of the war. Meme was shocked by the curiously old-fashioned and provincial way of life she found in 1950s New Zealand, but for various reasons she stayed, got married, and became involved in a variety of campaigns to enlarge its culture. She managed one of the first dealer art galleries, started one of its first European-style coffee bars, championed international cuisine, promoted fashion for women, and taught Italian language and culture at the University of Auckland. Meme's account offers rich insights into New Zealand social history and entertaining stories about the colourful people with whom she worked and partied.""--Cover.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1141943?k=chinese,Unknown

With its peak during the late-Ming period, this art remained a fixed feature in Chinese literature and visual arts until well into the 20th century. At its best, Chinese erotic art is a search for beauty in all its manifestations, for not only does it offer stimulation, it provides a source of great aesthetic pleasure. It never presents sex in a crude or pornographical way, but within a framework of beauty and harmony, enhanced with details of a profound or symbolic nature. DREAMS OF SPRING presents for the first time the treasures of one of the world's most important collections of Chinese erotic art. The text and descriptions in this book are the result of many years of scholarly research by one of the principal authorities in this field; Rev. Yimen, who studied Chinese history and literature at the major universities of China, before devoting herself to this neglected field of China's spiritual traditions.""--Dust jacket.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1137816?k=chinese,Unknown

As an activity, beadwork was once an important part of a Peranakan Chinese girl's set of skills. As an object, carefully crafted Nyonya beadwork was used at weddings and other celebratory occasions, touching the lives of Peranakan men and women, young and old. In this way, Nyonya beadwork became entwined within the wider relationships of gender, generation, and social hierarchy in Peranakan society. The Peranakans also incorporated into their beadwork styles and motifs that reflected their changing ideals, aspirations, and lifestyles. Inscribed into the history of Nyonya beadwork is a narrative of the Peranakan Chinese community's cultural transformations.""--Inside front cover.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1138451?k=chinese,Unknown

In this selection of Chinese court dress dating from the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the phrase ""you are what you wear"" resonates. Vollmer journeys back to thirteenth-century Jin dynasty Chinese empire, where ancestors of the Manchu conquerors dressed fittingly. These beautiful garments remind us that although royalty once set fashion standards in the way that celebrities do today, these robes also promoted distinct national and political messages that helped to keep a ruling minority in power for nearly three hundred years."" ""Over fifty colour photographs, including details of exquisitely wrought robes for members of the imperial Qing court, period portraits, and details from a rare hand scroll illustrating the Chinese emperor's tour of cities along the Grand Canal, bring Dressed to Rule: 18th Century Court Attire in the Mactaggart Art Collection to life.""

He was accompanied by Staunton, and a retinue of suitably impressive size, including Staunton's 11-year-old son who was nominally the ambassador's page. On the embassy's arrival in China it emerged that the 11-year-old was the only European member of the embassy able to speak Mandarin, and thus the only one able to converse with the Emperor. The embassy, the first such to China, had two objectives: the first to register with the Emperor British displeasure at the treatment that the British merchants were receiving from the Chinese, the second to gain permission for a British minister to be resident in China. The first objective was achieved, the second was not. Macartney was twice granted an audience with the Emperor and in December 1793 he was sumptuously entertained by the Chinese viceroy in Canton, and returned to England via Macao and St. Helena, arriving in September 1794.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1136060?k=chinese,Unknown

As a failed peasant-scholar leads the biggest uprising against any emperor in Chinese history, the terror felt by all the citizens of Suzhou is very real, for the heart of their city is being transformed into a mass execution ground. Zhou Yu has quickly become known in the rebel army as a fearless and mighty warrior. But after he helplessly watches the decapitation of his brother in the town square, he is forced to flee Suzhou. As soon as his father smuggles Yu into his missionary aunt's Shanghai sanctuary, she risks all by hiding him and securing him passage on a ship headed for Australia. As Yu's adventures in a new world begin, he secures work in the goldfields where the white man is hungry for a fast profit. In this compelling story, a young soldier soon discovers that the tentacles of China and his bloody past have the power to reach beyond the seas to a remote village in faraway New Zealand, forever teaching him about the burden of life and death in a changing world""--Back cover",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1134456?k=chinese,Unknown

1125,A communist in the family : searching for Rewi Alley,2019,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reading Room,Unknown,Unknown,"A Communist in the Family: Searching for Rewi Alley is a beautifully written multi-layered narrative centred on New Zealander Rewi Alley and his part in the momentous political events of mid-twentieth-century China. Part-biography, part-travel journal, part-literary commentary, A Communist in the Family brings together Alleys story and that of his author cousin, Elspeth Sandys. In 2017, Sandys travelled to China with other family members to mark the ninetieth anniversary of Rewis arrival in Shanghai in 1927. One strand of this book follows that journey and charts Sandys impressions of modern China. Another tells the story of Rewis early life, in an insightful meditation on the complex and always elusive relationship between memory and writing. By placing the man, Rewi, and his work in the context of his time, Sandys is able to illuminate the life of this extraordinary New Zealander in a way that is both historically vivid and relevant to the world of today. Her focus on the role poetry played in his life both his own and that of the Chinese poets he translated so prolifically provides moving glimpses of the man behind the myth. Threaded through A Communist in the Family are Sandys evolving insights into a nation that looms ever larger in the day-to-day realities of New Zealand and the world. The strange and strangely intimate link between the two countries Rewi regarded as home is one in which he played, and continues to play, a crucial role.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1135070?k=chinese,Unknown

1334,An authentic account of an embassy from the King of Great Britain to the Emperor of China ... : Taken  chiefly from the papers of ... the Earl of Macartney ... Sir Erasmus Gower ... and of other gentlemen,1797,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reserve Collection - Extra Outsize; Reserve Collection - XXOS,Unknown,Unknown,"This is the official report on the British Macartney Embassy to China that took place between 1792-1794. It was written down after the return to England by the Secretary to the mission Sir George Leonard Staunton, 1st Baronet (1737-1801), based on his own observations and notes from other crewmembers, including his twelve-year-old son Sir George Thomas Staunton, 2nd Baronet. The official publisher to King George III, W.Bulmer & CO for George Nicol published the account in 1797.; The account offers rich insights into the beginnings of the British Imperialism in China and thus makes it an important primary source for the historiography of Sino-Western relations. There is an academic dispute whether the account marks a breaking point in British-Chinese dynamics or should be interpreted as a sign for a slow and complex divergence.; While the political and economical ambitions of the embassy failed, the account by Staunton brought back detailed descriptions and observations on the Chinese culture that were received with curiosity in the West and led to the commercial success of the book and the publication of several translations and subsequent writings on the Macartney Mission.--Wikipedia, 2018.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1160664?k=chinese,Unknown

1659,The butterflies of Hong Kong,1999?,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,General Collection,Unknown,Unknown,"Hong Kong has a marvelously rich and diverse butterfly fauna, all contained within a relatively small area which can be seen and enjoyed within a few days outing from the central city area. An important part of the southern Chinese region, it is home to a significant proportion of the butterfly species of that part of the world. Two-hundred nineteen butterfly species in five families and 17 subfamilies have been recorded and all are described in this encyclopedic reference. A complete and up-to-date handbook on the identification, systematics, biology and ecology of the butterflies found in Hong Kong, this authoritative book includes keys, full colour plates and line drawings identifying males and females, as well as eggs and papae.

The first half of the paper was published in German and the second half in English. Emil Lubke edited the German text while F Muller, from Queensland, edited the English section. When Muller left in January 1910 his place was taken by James Ah Sue of Chinese-Samoan heritage.; With the New Zealand occupation of Samoa on 29 August 1914 changes to the ownership and content were bound to follow. James Ah Sue effectively took over the editorship of the paper and the newspaper's name changed to The Samoa Times as from January 1915. The paper became an English language newspaper with a German language supplement, which continued into 1916. In July 1916 the paper was bought by James Ah Sue who edited the paper until his death on 21 November 1918 from influenza.; The Samoa Times continued until 28 February 1930. It was replaced by the Samoa Herald, which ran until 27 March 1936 and was continued by the Western Samoa Mail, which ceased publication on 28 March 1942 due to the war.--Papers Past website.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1134161?k=chinese,Unknown

1794,Entanglement : the secret lives of hair,2016,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reading Room,Unknown,Unknown,"""When it's not attached to your head, your very own hair takes on a disconcerting quality. Suddenly, it is strange. And yet hair finds its way into all manner of unexpected places, far from our heads, including cosmetics, clothes, ropes, personal and public collections, and even food. Whether treated as waste or as gift, relic, sacred offering or commodity in a billion-dollar industry for wigs and hair extensions, hair has many stories to tell. Collected from Hindu temples and Buddhist nunneries and salvaged by the strand from waste heaps and the combs of long-haired women, hair flows into the industry from many sources. Entering this strange world, Emma Tarlo travels the globe, tracking its movement across India, Myanmar, China, Africa, the United States, Britain and Europe, where she meets people whose livelihoods depend on hair. Viewed from inside Chinese wig factories, Hindu temples and the villages of Myanmar, or from Afro hair fairs, Jewish wig parlours, fashion salons and hair loss clinics in Britain and the United States, hair is oddly revealing of the lives of all it touches. From fashion and beauty to religion, politics and cultural identity, Emma Tarlo explores just how much our locks and curls tell us about who we are. Full of surprising revelations and penetrating insights, Entanglement will change the way you see hair for ever""--Publisher's information.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1138364?k=chinese,Unknown

1845,Tulagi : Pacific outpost of British empire,2019?,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reading Room,Unknown,Unknown,"Tulagi was the capital of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate between 1897 and 1942. The British withdrawal from the island during the Pacific War, its capture by the Japanese and the American reconquest left the island's facilities damaged beyond repair. After the war, Britain moved the capital to the American military base on Guadalcanal, which became Honiara.  The Tulagi settlement was an enclave of several small islands, the permanent population of which was never more than 600: 300 foreigners- one-third of European origin and most of the remainder Chinese- and an equivalent number of Solomon Islanders. Thousands of Solomon Islander males also passed through on their way to work on plantations and as boat crews, hospital patients and prisoners.  The history of the Tulagi enclave provides an understanding of the origins of modern Solomon Islands. Tulagi was also a significant outpost of the British Empire in the Pacific, which enables a close analysis of race, sex and class and the process of British colonisation and government in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1134869?k=chinese,Unknown

But there is much more to the WWII  story of the Gilbert Islands than a single battle. In addition to the Battle of Tarawa, this book also tells of  the periods of Japanese and American occupations, of coast-watching and German raiders. This history of a time  and place is also a story of the people involved. In addition to the Americans and Japanese it is also the story  of Gilbert and Ellice Islanders, New Zealanders, British, Chinese, German-Marshallese and ""Kai Viti"" people  (British Fiji citizens), who by one means or another became caught up in the war in the Gilbert Islands.""--Back  cover.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1174380?k=chinese,Unknown

1856,Unravelling threads : Asian mental health,2022,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Pamphlet Collection,Unknown,Unknown,"""I want to begin with our choice of yarn for the cover. It is a metaphor to illustrate the complexity of perspectives and experiences of mental health for Asian communities. The powerful narratives included in this zine are a testimony of it. It highlights that there are many ways in which mental health is spoken about and with each narrative, there is an unravelling of sorts. We have centred the voices of Asian peoples in this zine in the hope to amplify them because these voices, our voices, Asian voices are largely absent from the mainstream discourse of mental health. This zine sits within the wider kaupapa of Te Papa's Asian Mental Health project. The project came about as a response to our invisibility, marginalisation and lack of representation in Aotearoa mental health space. I want to say that I hope this zine moves you as it has done for me.

What kind of multicultural framework best suits New Zealand's rapidly expanding ethnic diversity? Can the Treaty of Waitangi - initially set up to accommodate British settlers and to recognise the tangata whenua - serve as the basis for New Zealand's immigration policy in the new millennium? Could all citizens embrace multiculturalism? Aotearoa New Zealand is a fusion of indigenous, settler and immigrant populations. This collection examining Asian communities in Aotearoa highlights the unresolved tensions between a dynamic biculturalism and the recognition of other ethnic minorities that are increasingly asserting themselves. Multiculturalism and Asian-ness are addressed together for the first time in this articulate addition to the ongoing debate about the population diversity of Aotearoa New Zealand""--Back cover.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1139883?k=chinese,Unknown

Trade textiles blended the traditional designs, skills, and tastes of their cultures of origin, with new techniques learned through global exchange, creating beautiful new works that are also historically fascinating. Interwoven Globe is the first book to analyze these textiles within the larger history of trade and design. Richly illustrated texts explore the interrelationship of textiles, commerce, and taste from the age of discovery to the 19th century, including a detailed discussion of 120 illuminating works. From the elaborate dyed and painted cotton goods of India to the sumptuous silks of Japan, China, Turkey, and Iran, the paths of influence are traced westward to Europe and the Americas. Essential to this exchange was the trade in highly valued natural dyes and dye products, underscoring the influence of global exploration on the aesthetics and production techniques of textiles, and the resulting fashion for the 'exotic.'""--Publisher's website.",https://www.aucklandmuseum.com/discover/collections/record/1141865?k=chinese,Unknown

He appears to be a credible man, and has for a number of years supported a good standing as a professor of the Christian religion. His nerves are so affected by his sufferings, as that he is incapable of writing himself, and the deficiency of his paper has been filled up by the compiler, under his inspection. Much pains has been taken in preparing this work for public view, to render it truly useful and beneficial to the world. Other publications have been consulted, and to make this narrative of more utility to the reader some additions to Mr. Patterson's communications have been thus received. [...]; Here the Reader may see the vanity of childhood and youth; and the transitions of riper years. We find before us the surprising sufferings of one of our fellow beings, and behold what God is able to uphold a worm of the dust to endure. We also see a poor distressed mortal, in the midst of his anguish, made happy n the God of his salvation, and calling upon others to taste and see how good the Lord is; and exhorting them to turn from their sins and unrighteousness to him.; The account given of the miserable state of the heathen on a part of this continent, and the islands, is quite affecting. While we like rational beings are plenteously clothed and fed, millions are in the most abject state of uncivilization, naked, and nearly so, and many considering the flesh of their fellow beings a most delicious morsel. But, one thing is very noticeable among them, their sacred rules of what they think is true worship, they do not violate, as thousands have their strictest obligations, who profess to believe in the religion of the Lord Jesus Christ.

And it left us with new technologies of death: tanks, planes, submarines, rapid-fire machine guns and poison gas. It introduced us to strategic bombing, to unrestricted war on civilians and mistreatment of prisoners. Most of all, it changed our world.  In its wake empires toppled, monarchies fell and political systems and geographic boundaries realigned. Instabilities were institutionalised, enmities enshrined.

2721,The Palgrave handbook of ethnicity,2019?,Unknown,Bib record,Unknown,Auckland Museum,Reading Room Reference,Unknown,Unknown,"""This handbook provides a comprehensive and cutting-edge analysis of ethnicity through diverse multidisciplinary lenses. It explores numerous aspects of ethnicity and how it is linked to a range of contemporary political, economic and social issues at the global, regional as well as local levels. In a world where globalization has enveloped and transformed societies through economic and financial integration, social media networks, knowledge transfer, transnational travel, technology and education, there is a tendency to frame issues largely from the standpoint of economic, political and strategic interests of the dominant powers. Issues such as ethnic and cultural identity are often ignored partly because they are too complex to deal with. In this regard, the study of ethnicity is critical in delving deeper into people's worldviews, perceptions of each other, relationships and sence of identification to help us uncover some of the deeper perceptions and meanings of social change as seen and shared by cultural groups as they adapt to the fast-changing world. To better inform ourselves of the complexities of ethnicity and relationship to contemporary global developments and challenges, an approach which is people-centered, balanced, comprehensive and research-based is needed. The multidisciplinary approach of this handbook provides conceptual and empirical narratives across different disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, political studies, cultural studies, media studies, literature, law, development studies and economics, to name a few. It includes comparative case studies from different parts of the world to enrich our understanding of the diverse experiences.
